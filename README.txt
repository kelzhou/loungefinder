Lounge Finder

Run the application: python loungefinder.py

This is an application to find available lounges and reserve lounges in the high rise buildings.

There are 3 main pages, the main, the lounges, and the reservations page. 

The lounges page show all the lounges in the high rises and their availiabilty which is default set to unknown.There is a form on the side that can be used to update the status of the lounges.
The page will update the lounge status to "Taken" if there is a reservation at the current time. Once the reserved time is over, the status will go back to "Don't Know".

The reservation page show the reservations of all the lounges and there is a form on the side to reserve a lounge.

The idea behind the app is that if everyone uses it and updates the lounge status, the application will be very helpful and accurate. No one will have to spend time going from floor to floor to find a place to study or chill. 
The application is definitely not complete as there are a lot of things that can be added and modified but I spend a lot of time making sure all functionality works and improving the user interface.

Thanks :)
